  i understand english, japanese and chinese, but i can't speak japanese. i can speak chinese, but it'd be in broken dialects. i can speak english but i will occasionally mess up. i can type japanese but typing chinese will take a bit longer for me. and my french is literally at primary school level, but i can understand most of it.
